# RepoToolbox (WIP!)
A static (iOS) APT repository management tool

## Update 10.02.2020:
As of now this is open-sourced as WIP because I no longer have time to work on this project (others have taken priority)

The it compiles and works fine, however package deletion is somewhat faulty. Anyone who'd like to work on this is free todo so, please do give credit!

I apologize if anyone has waited for this release, I hope you understand. For questions around this (serious ones), feel free to hit me up on Twitter @saadat603 :-)
## Introduction
If you own an iOS repo, you probably know how tedious it can get from writing depictions to proper management of packages.
There is no lack of templates, however I would also like to contribute to the community so here's _RepoToolbox:_
A Windows based and GUI driven repository management.

This is intended to be used with GitHub Pages, you can probably also deploy this on your own server.
Instructions on how to set it up can be found in the wiki!

It's been paused due to university, but here we are! Written entirely in C#, please feel free to browse through the code and __please make sure to read the wiki!__
