# RepoToolbox
A static (iOS) APT repository management tool

## Introduction
If you own an iOS repo, you probably know how tedious it can get from writing depictions to proper management of packages.
There is no lack of templates, however I would also like to contribute to the community so here's _RepoToolbox:_
A Windows based and GUI driven repository management.

This is intended to be used with GitHub Pages, you can probably also deploy this on your own server.
